## Getting Started
- Run goexec init to create a default goexec sripting cli in your current directory
- You will be prompted for the name of the directory to create(this will be the name of the cli)
- After entering a directory name, a folder containing the cli, along with a default goexec.yaml will be created
- Enter the created directory and install the program
- Run the command to see the default subcommands and flags

The default generated cli will print its usage if called without any subcommands. It should look like this:

## Default Goexec Usage
A goexec cli comes with default subcommands built in.

Here is the usage for a goexec cli that was generated with the name "scripter":

---> Change me to a longer descripton of your goexec cli <---

Usage:
  scripter [command]

Available Commands:
  debug       debug flags or current configuration
  help        Help about any command
  load        download all of your executable dependencies
  script      run bash scripts

Flags:
  -h, --help      help for scripter
      --version   version for scripter

Use "scripter [command] --help" for more information about a command.

"load" subcommands:

download all of your executable dependencies

Usage:
  scripter load [command]

Available Commands:
  get         intelligently download folders/files from a remote url
  mod         download go mod executable dependencies

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for load

"debug" subcommands:
debug flags or current configuration

Usage:
  scripter debug [command]

Available Commands:
  config      debug configuration settings
  flags       debug current flag settings

Flags:
  -h, --help   help for debug

## Configuration

- Your GoExec cli will read in all files that are named either goexec.yaml or goexec.json
- Your configuration settings are automatically synced to environmental variables
- Your configuration settings can be used to template scripts added to the cli

## Templating

- Goexec uses the excellent sprig funcmap functions package ref:https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig
- Goexec renders scripts that contain "{{" with your current configuration settings and the sprig funcmap
ex: 
if you set name: "Coleman Word" in a goexec.yaml file in your current directory and add the following script:
echo "hello {{ .name }}" >> name.txt

it will create a name.txt file containing "Coleman Word"
